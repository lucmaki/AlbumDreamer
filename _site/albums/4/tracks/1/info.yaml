imagery: "A panoramic view of the Lands Between with the towering Erdtree at the center, bathed in golden light, with its roots stretching across the land, and its branches reaching towards the sky."
music: "A solemn, majestic orchestral piece with lush strings, grand brass, gentle harp, and a soft choir. The melody is carried by a solo cello, signifying the lone, majestic presence of the Erdtree."
