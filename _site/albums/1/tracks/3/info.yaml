title: "River Styx Serenade"
imagery: "A wide, murky river under a starless sky. A lone figure rows a boat, ferrying spectral passengers. The water is mirror-like, reflecting the ghostly, phosphorescent figures."
music: "A slow, mournful tune begins on a solitary electric guitar, coupled with soft, rolling drums mimicking the sound of oars dipping in water. The melody is carried over to a bouzouki, with the eeriness amplified by an echoing, atmospheric synth."
