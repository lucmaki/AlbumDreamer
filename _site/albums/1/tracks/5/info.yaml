title: "Asphodel Ascendance"
imagery: "Fields of asphodel flowers under a twilight sky, a pathway of stars leading upwards. Transparent souls ascend, their forms flickering like fireflies."
music: "Beginning with an echoing, simple melody on the lyre, the track slowly builds with layers of guitars and strings, gradually transforming from somber to hopeful. The drums lead the rhythm, giving a sense of journey and ascendance towards a more positive, major-key resolution."
