 title: "Riffs from the Underworld"
 topic: "Hades The Metalhead"
 description : "Embark on an epic auditory journey with five unique instrumental pieces. Each track paints a distinct soundscape, taking you from the imposing, powerful gates of the underworld to the serene, ethereal Elysium fields. Traverse the murky River Styx and tremble at the depths of Tartarus, before ascending towards the hopeful Asphodel skies. All brought to life through a blend of heavy metal intensity and the grandeur of ancient Greek instruments and symphony."
 imagery: "Lone figure shrouded in black, holding a fiery electric guitar under a night sky. Behind him, an obsidian palace and a river winding into spectral fields under a blood-red sky."
