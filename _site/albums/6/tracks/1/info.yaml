title: "Brockton Bay Nocturne"
imagery: "A nighttime cityscape viewed from above, with various districts subtly differentiated - upscale neighborhoods, grimy industrial areas, neglected slums. The city is suffused with a soft, eerie luminescence from thousands of insects, all under the control of a solitary figure on a rooftop."
music: "A haunting orchestral piece with melancholic strings and a pulsating synth bass line, interspersed with delicate chimes to represent the insects."
