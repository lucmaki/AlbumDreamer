title: "Leviathan's Arrival"
imagery: "A towering monstrosity rising from the ocean, dwarfing the city before it. Waves crash around it, and storm clouds gather overhead, casting an ominous shadow over the scene."
music: "An epic orchestral track with heavy use of timpani and brass for the creature's looming presence, interspersed with frantic string passages to represent the city's panic and fear."
