title: "Cherry Pie Reverie"
imagery: "An immaculate cherry pie sits atop a checkered tablecloth, with a single slice revealing the vibrant red filling. In the glossy surface of the pie, the entire town of Twin Peaks is reflected."
music: "A warm, nostalgic piece featuring a gentle, fingerpicked acoustic guitar melody, backed by soft strings and brushed drums. Occasional vibraphone notes and a lulling accordion lend a whimsical, slightly surreal quality to the track."
