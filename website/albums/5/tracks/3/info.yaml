title: "Diner at Dusk"
imagery: "A warmly lit 50s-style diner seen from outside. The neon sign is reflected on the wet asphalt, and the sky is a mix of warm oranges and purples. Inside, silhouettes hint at a secret rendezvous."
music: "A melancholic jazz-infused piece featuring a laid-back upright bass line, brushed drum loops, and a lonely, echoing trumpet melody. Ambient city sounds and soft diner chatter are subtly woven into the background."
