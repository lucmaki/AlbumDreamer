title: "Lodge of the Mind"
imagery: "A labyrinthine forest at night, the trees forming patterns that evoke the winding corridors of a massive, otherworldly lodge. The moon glows red in the sky."
music: "An unsettling, atmospheric piece. Dark, droning synths underpin a dissonant melody played on a detuned piano, punctuated by discordant string stabs and ethereal choir harmonies."
