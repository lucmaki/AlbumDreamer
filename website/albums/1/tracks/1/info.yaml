title: "Underworld Overture"
imagery: "An imposing, obsidian-black palace under a blood-red sky, the gateway to the underworld. Flames dance, casting long, eerie shadows. In the distance, skeletal trees and spectral figures under the twilight."
music: "Intense and dark, the track opens with thunderous drumming and distorted guitars, before a haunting melody is introduced on an ancient Greek lyre. The symphony gradually builds with strings and choir to create an orchestral wall of sound."
