title: "Baker Street Reverie"
imagery: "An intimate view of Sherlock's study room in 221B Baker Street at dusk. Silhouettes of scattered papers, books, and chemistry equipment are visible against the glow of a single oil lamp. The violin rests against an armchair, waiting to be played."
music: "A haunting solo violin melody, backed by delicate piano chords and subtle string harmonies, building up to a mysterious and contemplative soundscape that mirrors Sherlock's profound thoughts."
