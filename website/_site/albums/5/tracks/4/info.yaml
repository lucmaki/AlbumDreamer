title: "Through the Curtains"
imagery: "A heavy red velvet curtain shimmers in an undefined space. The curtain is partly drawn to reveal a surreal landscape of reversed waterfalls and floating orbs of light."
music: "A dreamlike, cinematic composition featuring reversed harp and piano sequences layered over warm, resonant synth drones. Occasional chiming bell tones and soft percussive hits add a sense of enigmatic mystery."
