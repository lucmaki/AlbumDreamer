title: "Tartarus Tremors"
imagery: "A dark, ominous pit with flashes of lightning revealing monstrous silhouettes. Chains and the ruins of mighty fortifications hint at the torment and punishment within."
music: "This track is heavy and dissonant, filled with powerful, distorted guitar riffs, pounding drums, and disconcerting, chaotic effects. The sound of clanging chains can be heard as part of the percussion, punctuating the atmospheric dread."
