title: "Echoes of Elysium"
imagery: "Verdant fields and golden skies, but with an ethereal, almost dreamlike quality. Souls of the virtuous roam free, appearing as glowing specters, peaceful amidst the celestial landscape."
music: "This track starts with a serene and harmonious blend of lyre, flutes, and gentle percussion, slowly layering with ethereal synth sounds to create a feeling of peace and otherworldliness. It maintains a gentle crescendo, leading to a powerful, orchestral finale."
