title: "Shadows on the Lake"
imagery: "A serene yet eerie lake under a twilight sky, cast in deep purples and blues. A single white swan glides across the water, leaving an unsettling ripple in its wake."
music: "A slow-building ambient track with layered synth pads creating an atmosphere of mystery and unease. Sparse, echoing piano notes punctuate the soundscape, accompanied by distant, ethereal strings."
