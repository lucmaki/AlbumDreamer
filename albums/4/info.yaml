 title: "Symphony of the Gilded Twilight"
 topic: "The Erdtree"
 description : "This is a journey through a land touched by the divine and scarred by the ancient, a land where life and death intertwine. Each track is a chapter of its tale: a melody of quiet majesty, an anthem of grace, echoes of primordial times, a symphony of grand conflict, and a lament for a fading age. Prepare to be immersed in the diverse, haunting, and beautiful soundscapes of this land."
 imagery: "Majestic golden tree towering above a vast, twilight-hued landscape; surreal swirls of color in the sky, reflecting the tree's golden glow; silhouettes of strange, mystical creatures roaming the land below."
